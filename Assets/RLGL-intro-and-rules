You are taken to a large room painted to look like an open field. At the other end you see two masked men with guns and
a large robotic girl with unsettling eyes. You and your fellow players line up for a game of Red light, Green light.

The rules are as follows:

1) You may attempt to move while the robot's head is turned.
2) If you are caught moving after the robot turns, you will be eliminated.
3) You have 1 minute to cross the field.
4) If you are still on the field after 1 minute, you will be eliminated.

Each player is represented on the board by a O while they are in play. After elimination they are replaced with an X.
To tell yourself apart from the other players, you are represented by a P.

Good luck!
